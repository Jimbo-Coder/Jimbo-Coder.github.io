I am a third year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign. I am studying Numerical Relativity, which is concerned with solving Einstein's Field Equations on a (super)computer. With my advisor Dr. Antonios Tsokaros, we are looking at single and binary Neutron Stars, and Magnetized Self-Consistent Neutron Star evolution.
